# Data Analysis with Bootstrap Sampling

This repository contains a Python script (```data_analysis_ufrpe.py```) or a Jupyter Notebook (```data_analysis_ufrpe.ipynb```) designed to analyze data generated by a fault injector for a video monitoring system ([link to the fault injector]).

## Features
### Data Analysis: Processes data obtained from the fault injector. The input data corresponds to a video monitoring system under specific conditions.
### Bootstrap Sampling: Implements the bootstrap technique to resample the input data.
### Confidence Interval Calculation: Generates confidence intervals based on the resampled data.

## Input Data
The input data is stored in the file ```data_monitoring_baseline.txt```. This file contains the fault injector's output.
